//! Versioned schema migration framework, shared by the two SQL backends
//! (`db` SeaORM + `libsql` edge). The execution differs per backend (SeaORM
//! raw SQL vs. hand SQL over `LibsqlClient::execute`), but the *migration list*
//! and the version-ordering logic live here, once.
//!
//! ## Model
//!
//! A `schema_migrations(version INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, applied_at INTEGER)` table
//! tracks which migrations have been applied. On connect each SQL backend:
//!
//!   1. runs its existing `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` baseline (entity-driven
//!      for `db`, the hand `TABLES` list for `libsql`) — this lands a *fresh*
//!      DB at the current schema, and is a no-op on an already-created DB;
//!   2. ensures `schema_migrations` exists;
//!   3. reads `MAX(version)` (0 when the table is empty);
//!   4. if the table is empty, **stamps [`latest_version`]** without running
//!      any SQL — step 1 just ensured the *current* schema, so every listed
//!      migration is already reflected in the tables and replaying one (e.g. an
//!      `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN`) would fail on the fresh DB;
//!   5. applies every [`MIGRATIONS`] entry with `version >` the stamped max, in
//!      ascending order, recording each in `schema_migrations`.
//!
//! Idempotent and safe to run on every boot.
//!
//! ## Support boundary
//!
//! A previously-unstamped DB is assumed to already match the current schema
//! (step 4). That holds for any DB first booted on or after this framework
//! landed; DBs created by *earlier* builds whose tables predate later column
//! changes are **not upgradable in place** — recreate them (or `ALTER` by
//! hand).
//!
//! ## Adding a migration
//!
//! Every schema change must land in **three places**, or it breaks on one
//! class of database:
//!
//!   - the SeaORM entity (`db/entities/`) — fresh DBs on the `db` backend;
//!   - the `libsql` `TABLES` list (`libsql/schema.rs`) — fresh edge DBs;
//!   - a [`Migration`] entry here — **existing** DBs on both backends.
//!
//! Append the [`Migration`] with the next integer version (keep the list
//! sorted ascending). Use dialect-portable SQL (sqlite/pg/mysql) since the
//! same `sql` runs on both backends. Example:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! Migration {
//!     version: 2,
//!     description: "add providers.region",
//!     sql: &["ALTER TABLE providers ADD COLUMN region TEXT"],
//! }
//! ```

/// The version stamped for the auto-created baseline schema. Migrations in
/// [`MIGRATIONS`] must use versions strictly greater than this.
pub const BASELINE_VERSION: i64 = 1;

/// A single ordered schema migration. `sql` may hold multiple statements, each
/// executed in list order (one statement per backend call).

    /// Strictly-increasing version; must be `> BASELINE_VERSION` and unique.
    pub version: i64,

    pub description: &'static str,
    /// Statements to run, in order. Keep dialect-portable (sqlite/pg/mysql).
    pub sql: &'static [&'static str],

/// Portable DDL for the bookkeeping table. `INTEGER` is accepted by all three
/// dialects; no autoincrement needed (the version is supplied explicitly).

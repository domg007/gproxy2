//! Pluggable cache backend abstraction.
//!
//! Native implementations:
//! - [`MemoryCache`] — in-process, no external dependencies; single-instance deployments.
//! - [`RedisCache`] — Redis-backed; multi-instance / shared cache.
//!
//! Edge (wasm32) implementations:
//! - [`LibsqlCache`] — libSQL/Turso HTTP-backed kv table.
//! - [`UpstashCache`] — Upstash Redis REST API.
//!
//! Business code depends only on [`CacheBackend`]; the concrete impl is
//! selected at startup based on `CacheConfig`.
